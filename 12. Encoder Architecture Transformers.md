# Encoder Architecture in Transformers: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's build up a complete understanding of transformer encoders, starting from the ground up. I'll explain each component thoroughly so you can see how everything fits together.

## 1. What is an Encoder and What Does It Do?

At its heart, a transformer encoder is designed to take a sequence of items (like words in a sentence) and create rich, context-aware representations of each item. Unlike earlier sequence models that processed items one by one, transformers process the entire sequence at once.

Think of the encoder as a smart note-taker who reads an entire paragraph and then writes detailed notes about each word, including how it relates to all the other words.

## 2. The Big Picture: Encoder Block Components

Before diving into details, let's get a bird's-eye view of what makes up a transformer encoder:

1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert tokens (like words) into vectors
2. **Positional Encodings**: Add information about position in the sequence
3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allow the model to focus on different parts of the input
4. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Process each position independently
5. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize the learning process
6. **Residual Connections**: Help information flow through the network

These components are arranged in a specific way to form an encoder block, and several blocks are typically stacked together.

## 3. Input Embeddings: Turning Words into Numbers

The first step is to convert our input tokens (like words) into vectors that the model can work with.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TokenEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.d_model = d_model
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Multiply by sqrt(d_model) to scale embeddings
        # This helps with training stability
        return self.embedding(x) * (self.d_model ** 0.5)
```

Let's say we have a vocabulary of 5,000 words, and we want to represent each word as a 512-dimensional vector. The embedding layer would create a table with 5,000 rows (one for each word) and 512 columns (the dimensions of our representation).

When we input the word "cat" (which might be token ID 243), the embedding layer looks up row 243 and returns that 512-dimensional vector.

## 4. Positional Encoding: Adding Location Information

As I explained earlier, transformers process all tokens simultaneously, so they need extra information about token positions. Positional encodings add unique patterns to each position.

```python
import math

class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, max_seq_length=5000):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Create positional encoding matrix
        pe = torch.zeros(max_seq_length, d_model)
        
        # Create position indices: [0, 1, 2, ...]
        position = torch.arange(0, max_seq_length, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        
        # Create division term for sine/cosine functions
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
        
        # Apply sine to even indices
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        
        # Apply cosine to odd indices
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        
        # Add batch dimension
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)
        
        # Register as buffer (not a parameter to be trained)
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Add positional encoding to input embeddings
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        x = x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1), :]
        return x
```

These sine and cosine patterns create a unique "fingerprint" for each position that the model can learn to recognize.

## 5. Multi-Head Self-Attention: The Heart of the Transformer

This is where the magic happens. Self-attention allows each token to "look at" all other tokens in the sequence and gather relevant information.

### 5.1 Self-Attention: Basic Concept

Imagine you're reading a sentence like "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too wide." What does "it" refer to? To understand, you need to relate "it" to other words in the sentence.

Self-attention works similarly:
1. For each token, we create three vectors: a Query, a Key, and a Value
2. We compare the Query of the current token with the Keys of all tokens
3. This comparison gives us attention weights - how much to focus on each token
4. We use these weights to take a weighted sum of all Value vectors

Let's implement this:

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    """Calculate attention weights and apply them to values."""
    # query, key, value shapes: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dimension]
    
    # Calculate attention scores
    # matmul: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, seq_length]
    matmul_qk = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    
    # Scale the attention scores
    d_k = query.size(-1)
    scaled_attention_scores = matmul_qk / math.sqrt(d_k)
    
    # Apply mask if provided (for padding or future masking)
    if mask is not None:
        scaled_attention_scores = scaled_attention_scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    
    # Apply softmax to get attention weights
    # attention_weights: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, seq_length]
    attention_weights = torch.softmax(scaled_attention_scores, dim=-1)
    
    # Apply attention weights to values
    # output: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dimension]
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    
    return output, attention_weights
```

### 5.2 Why "Multi-Head"?

Instead of performing attention once, we perform it multiple times in parallel with different learned projections. This allows the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously.

Think of it like having multiple people read the same text, each focusing on different aspects:
- One person focuses on grammar relationships
- Another focuses on factual consistency
- A third focuses on emotional tone
- And so on...

Each "head" can learn to specialize in different types of relationships.

### 5.3 Implementing Multi-Head Attention

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        assert d_model % num_heads == 0, "d_model must be divisible by num_heads"
        
        self.d_model = d_model  # Embedding dimension
        self.num_heads = num_heads  # Number of attention heads
        self.head_dim = d_model // num_heads  # Dimension of each head
        
        # Linear projections for Q, K, V
        self.q_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.k_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.v_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
        # Final output projection
        self.out_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def split_heads(self, x, batch_size):
        """Split the last dimension into (num_heads, head_dim)."""
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        
        # Reshape to [batch_size, seq_length, num_heads, head_dim]
        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.head_dim)
        
        # Transpose to [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dim]
        return x.transpose(1, 2)
    
    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        
        # Linear projections and split into heads
        q = self.split_heads(self.q_linear(query), batch_size)
        k = self.split_heads(self.k_linear(key), batch_size)
        v = self.split_heads(self.v_linear(value), batch_size)
        
        # Calculate attention
        scaled_attention, attention_weights = scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, mask)
        
        # Combine heads
        # Transpose back to [batch_size, seq_length, num_heads, head_dim]
        scaled_attention = scaled_attention.transpose(1, 2).contiguous()
        
        # Reshape to [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        concat_attention = scaled_attention.view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)
        
        # Apply final linear projection
        output = self.out_linear(concat_attention)
        
        return output, attention_weights
```

## 6. Feed-Forward Neural Network: Individual Processing

After the attention mechanism captures relationships between tokens, each token is processed independently through a feed-forward neural network.

This network typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between:

```python
class FeedForward(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, d_ff, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        
        # First linear transformation expands dimension
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, d_ff)
        
        # Second linear transformation reduces back to original dimension
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(d_ff, d_model)
        
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        
        # First linear + ReLU activation
        x = self.relu(self.linear1(x))
        
        # Apply dropout
        x = self.dropout(x)
        
        # Second linear
        x = self.linear2(x)
        
        return x
```

The feed-forward network allows each position to process its information independently after gathering context through the attention mechanism. You can think of it as each token "thinking about" the information it just collected.

## 7. Layer Normalization: Stabilizing Training

Layer normalization helps keep the values flowing through the network within a reasonable range, which helps with training stability.

```python
class LayerNorm(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, eps=1e-6):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Learnable parameters for scaling and shifting
        self.gamma = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(d_model))
        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_model))
        
        # Small constant for numerical stability
        self.eps = eps
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        
        # Calculate mean and variance along the last dimension
        mean = x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
        std = x.std(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
        
        # Normalize
        normalized = (x - mean) / (std + self.eps)
        
        # Scale and shift with learnable parameters
        return self.gamma * normalized + self.beta
```

Layer normalization is applied after both the attention and feed-forward parts of the encoder.

## 8. Residual Connections: Preserving Information

Residual connections (or skip connections) allow information to flow directly from earlier layers to later layers. They simply add the input of a sublayer to its output.

They help with two things:
1. Training very deep networks without vanishing gradients
2. Preserving important information that might otherwise be lost

Instead of implementing them as a separate module, we'll incorporate them into our encoder layer.

## 9. Putting It All Together: The Encoder Layer

Now let's combine all these components to create a complete encoder layer:

```python
class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, d_ff, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Multi-head attention
        self.mha = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, num_heads)
        
        # Feed-forward network
        self.ffn = FeedForward(d_model, d_ff, dropout)
        
        # Layer normalization
        self.norm1 = LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = LayerNorm(d_model)
        
        # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]
        
        # Multi-head attention with residual connection and layer norm
        attn_output, _ = self.mha(x, x, x, mask)
        attn_output = self.dropout1(attn_output)
        # First residual connection
        out1 = self.norm1(x + attn_output)
        
        # Feed-forward network with residual connection and layer norm
        ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)
        ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output)
        # Second residual connection
        out2 = self.norm2(out1 + ffn_output)
        
        return out2
```

Let's walk through the flow:
1. Input `x` goes through the multi-head attention layer
2. We apply dropout to the attention output
3. We add the original input `x` to the attention output (residual connection)
4. We apply layer normalization
5. This output goes through the feed-forward network
6. We apply dropout to the feed-forward output
7. We add the feed-forward output to the previous layer's output (another residual connection)
8. We apply layer normalization again
9. The final result is the output of the encoder layer

## 10. The Complete Encoder: Stacking Multiple Layers

The full transformer encoder consists of:
1. Input embeddings
2. Positional encoding
3. A stack of N identical encoder layers

Let's put everything together:

```python
class TransformerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, 
                 vocab_size, 
                 d_model=512, 
                 num_heads=8, 
                 num_layers=6, 
                 d_ff=2048, 
                 max_seq_length=5000, 
                 dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Token embedding layer
        self.embedding = TokenEmbedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        
        # Positional encoding
        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(d_model, max_seq_length)
        
        # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
        # Stack of encoder layers
        self.encoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EncoderLayer(d_model, num_heads, d_ff, dropout) 
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])
        
        # Final layer normalization
        self.norm = LayerNorm(d_model)
        
    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        # x shape: [batch_size, seq_length]
        
        # Apply token embeddings
        x = self.embedding(x)
        
        # Add positional encoding
        x = self.positional_encoding(x)
        
        # Apply dropout
        x = self.dropout(x)
        
        # Pass through each encoder layer
        for layer in self.encoder_layers:
            x = layer(x, mask)
        
        # Apply final layer normalization
        output = self.norm(x)
        
        return output
```

## 11. Step-by-Step Flow Through the Encoder

Let's trace how a sentence flows through our encoder:

1. **Input**: We start with a sequence of token IDs, e.g., [101, 2054, 2003, 2204, 102] for "What is transformer?"

2. **Token Embeddings**: Each token ID is converted to a dense vector (e.g., 512 dimensions)
   - Shape changes from [batch_size, seq_length] to [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]

3. **Positional Encoding**: Position information is added to each token embedding
   - Shape remains [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]

4. **Encoder Layer 1**:
   - **Self-Attention**: Each token gathers information from all tokens
   - **Feed-Forward**: Each token processes its information independently
   - Shape remains [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]

5. **Encoder Layers 2-N**: Each layer refines the representations further

6. **Output**: After the final layer, we have context-aware representations for each token
   - Shape is still [batch_size, seq_length, d_model]

The final output contains rich representations that capture both the meaning of each token and its relationship to other tokens in the sequence.

## 12. A Concrete Example

Let's say we have a simple sentence: "I love transformers"

1. Convert to token IDs: [101, 1045, 2293, 19081, 102]

2. The embedding layer converts each token to a 512-dimensional vector.

3. Positional encoding adds position information to each token's embedding.

4. The first encoder layer:
   - In self-attention, "transformers" (token 19081) might heavily attend to "love" (token 2293)
   - The feed-forward network processes each token independently

5. As we go through more layers, the representations become increasingly sophisticated.

6. The final output is a sequence of vectors that capture the meaning of each token in context.

## 13. Complete Code for a Transformer Encoder

## 14. Testing the Encoder

Here's a simple way to test our encoder:

```python
# Initialize the encoder
encoder = TransformerEncoder(
    vocab_size=30000,  # Size of your vocabulary
    d_model=512,       # Embedding dimension
    num_heads=8,       # Number of attention heads
    num_layers=6,      # Number of encoder layers
    d_ff=2048,         # Feed-forward dimension
    dropout=0.1        # Dropout rate
)

# Create a sample input (batch_size=2, seq_length=5)
sample_input = torch.randint(0, 30000, (2, 5))

# Forward pass
output = encoder(sample_input)

# Check output shape
print(f"Input shape: {sample_input.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
# Should print: Output shape: torch.Size([2, 5, 512])
```

## 15. Key Takeaways

1. **Transformer encoders process entire sequences in parallel**, unlike RNNs which process tokens sequentially.

2. **Positional encoding** is needed because transformers don't have an inherent sense of token order.

3. **Self-attention** is the key innovation that allows tokens to gather information from all other tokens.

4. **Multi-head attention** lets the model focus on different aspects of the relationships between tokens.

5. **Feed-forward networks** process each token independently after gathering context.

6. **Layer normalization and residual connections** help with training stability and information flow.

7. **Stacking multiple encoder layers** allows the model to learn increasingly complex representations.

The transformer encoder architecture has revolutionized natural language processing by enabling more efficient and effective processing of sequential data. This architecture forms the foundation for models like BERT, RoBERTa, and many others that have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks.
