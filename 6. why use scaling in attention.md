# 📘 **Notes: Why We Divide by √dₖ in Attention**

---

## 🔁 1. Recap: **Self-Attention Flow**

Given a sentence like:
`"Love Apple phones"`

### Steps:

1. Get word embeddings → shape: `[3 × 512]`
2. Multiply with learned matrices:

   * W<sub>Q</sub>, W<sub>K</sub>, W<sub>V</sub> → each shape: `[512 × 64]`
   * Resulting Q, K, V → shape: `[3 × 64]`
3. Compute attention scores:

   ```
   scores = Q @ K.T → shape: [3 × 3]
   ```

   * e.g., scores\[1]\[0] = similarity between "Apple" and "Love"
4. Apply `softmax` → get probabilities (attention weights)
5. Multiply with V → final representations (same shape as input)

Final formula:
**`Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ)V`**

## ⚠️ 2. Problem: Why Do We Need to Scale?

### 👉 In Real Formula:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) V
```

But why divide by √dₖ?

## 📈 3. Root Cause: **Dot Product Variance Grows with Dimension**

### Matrix multiplication property:

> **Variance of dot product increases as vector size increases.**

### Example:

* Q and K → shape `[3 × 64]`
* So, score matrix → shape `[3 × 3]`
* But **values inside become large** as `dₖ = 64`

Why?

* Dot product is a **sum over dₖ terms**
* If each term contributes a small random value → sum = large variance

### 🔍 Intuition:

* 2D vectors → smaller value range (e.g., -23 to +23)
* 5D vectors → larger range (e.g., -49 to +122)
* More dimensions = more terms in sum = **higher deviation from mean**

---

## 🚨 4. Why High Variance Is a Problem in Deep Learning

### Softmax exaggerates gaps:

* Input `[7, 3]` → softmax → `[0.98, 0.02]`
* Large input gaps = attention focuses **too narrowly** (hard attention)

### Consequences:

* Only a **few weights** get updated (rest get multiplied with ≈0)
* **Gradient flow stops** → model can't learn effectively
  → **Vanishing Gradient Problem**

---

## 🧮 5. Why Divide by √dₖ?

### Goal:

> Keep variance stable even when dₖ increases.

Let’s say:

* When `dₖ = 1`, variance = `a`
* Then for `dₖ = 64`, variance = `64 × a`

So to bring variance back to `a`, we:

```
Divide by √dₖ
```

Because:

```
Var(x / √dₖ) = Var(x) / dₖ
```

This **scaling cancels out the increase**, keeping variance constant.

---

## ✅ Final Formula (Stable Attention):

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) V
```

* Keeps variance ≈ 1
* Smooths softmax output
* Ensures all weights contribute during training
* Prevents vanishing gradients

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q ⋅ K grows with dₖ              | More dimensions → larger dot products → higher variance  |
| High variance → softmax explodes | Softmax gives near-one-hot output → few weights updated  |
| Poor gradient flow               | Model fails to train → stuck learning only a few weights |
| Scaling with √dₖ                 | Normalizes variance → stable training                    |

## 📦 Summary in One Line

> We divide by √dₖ in attention to **normalize variance** of the dot product, which ensures **stable softmax, smoother gradients, and better training.**
